# Stating the imagine inspiration
- **Marvel's Flow Field** by *Summer Chao* from P5.js showcase
    - I found an imaging technique that Iâ€™d like to try it in my project, which present a line drawing shapes of complex graphics, and those shapes are able to twist or changing the shape randomly in real time. 
    - ![An image of an example](readmeImages/qpart1.png)
    - This kind of shape drawing and changing is the effect that I believe suitable for my project, it can create the feeling of moving, let my project has more motion and impact, and the randomness could bring more unexpected changes to audience.

## The coding technique example
- Code made by *Summer Chao* from P5.js showcase
    - The coding technique it used is similar with the Mona Lisa drawing in week 7. 
    - By placing picture on canvas and generate dots that contains the colour from the picture and using *array* to contain them. Generate them by **for loop** and using **noise()** to let them moving with randomness. 
    - ![An image of an example](readmeImages/cpart1.png)
    - The coding technique of this example is similar to what we have learnt, therefore it is a good choice to start with. The *array* using and noise function could let the work more organize and creative, createVector function can let the drawing dots moving more controllable and creative as well.
